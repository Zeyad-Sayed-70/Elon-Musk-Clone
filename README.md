# Tweetland Project

The application will have one main user role: regular users that will be able to create profiles, post tweets, follow other users, like and comment on tweets, and edit their own profiles.

The MERN Twitter Clone will use a RESTful API architecture for communication between the client and the server. The backend will be built using Node.js and Express.js, which will handle API requests and responses. MongoDB will be used as the database to store user profiles, tweets, and other data.

The frontend of the application will be built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The frontend will communicate with the backend through the API endpoints, and will display the tweets and user profiles to the users.

The MERN Twitter Clone will have several features including:

- User authentication and authorization
- User profile creation and editing
- Tweet creation, editing and deletion
- Tweet liking and retwetting
- Chating with Users
- End-To-End Testing using Cypress
- Switch Dark/Light Mode
- Multible Languages (English - Arabic)
